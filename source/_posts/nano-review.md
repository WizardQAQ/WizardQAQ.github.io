# Nanomaterials
## Defination
Nanotechnology can be broadly defined as the creation, processing, characterization and utilization of materials, devices andsystems with dimensions of the order of 10–100 nm, exhibiting novel and significantly enhanced physical, chemical and biological properties, functions, phenomena and processes, due to their nano-scale size.

A nanomaterialhas a typical grain size <100 nm, whereas ultrafine-grained materials are characterized by grain size <500 nm.
On the other hand, the term “nanocomposite” comprises multiphase materials, where at least one constituent phase has dimension of less than 100 nm

## Classification
>When talking about classifying, the standard of classificaition should be clarified. ~ By Glenn

### Nature of fabrication
1. Inorganic
2. Organic
3. Hybrid
### General Size
digraph G{
    Bulk -> Powders
    Powders -> Nanostructers
    Clusters -> Nanostructers
    Atoms -> Clusters
}
### Size of structural element
- 0D: Spheres, Clusters = 3 dimensions in the monometricrange
- 1D: Nanorods, Wires = 2 dimensions in the monometricrange
- 2D: Nanofilms, Plates = 1 dimensions in the monometricrange
- 3D: Nanoparticles = 0 dimensions in the monometricrange
Homogenity
???

## Nanomulsion
Dispersion of polymer, droplets and solid material in the form of a viscous liquid leads to an interesting soft material.

### Parts
- internal phase(dispersed phase or discontinuous phase)

- external phase(dispersion medium or continuous phase)

### Methods
- high energy: ultrasonification, high pressure homogenization and microfluidizer

- low energy: phase inversion temperature, solvent displacement and phase inversion composition

## Nano-composites
Nano-composites are found as a microcrystal matrix (micro-nanotype), in which nanometer sized particles or inclusions (spherical, fiber-like, plate-like) of a second phase are dispersed in the intergranular regions or in both inter/intra granular spaces of matrix grains.

### Classification by matrix materials
- CMC: Al2O3/SiO2, SiO2/Ni, Al2O3/SiC, Al2O3/CNT

- MMC: Fe-Cr/Al2O3, Ni-Cu/Al2O3, Co/Cr, Fe/MgO, Al/CNT, Mg/CNT, Cu/CNT/CNF

- PMC: Poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), poly ethylene glycol (PEG), poly caprolactone(PCL), poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), poly glycerol sebacate

### Classification of CMCs
1. Micro/nanocomposite, with rounded nanoparticles occupying both inter-and intra-granular positions inside a micronicmatrix;
2. Micro/nanocomposite, with elongated nanoreinforcementsembedded in a micronicmatrix;
3. Micro/nanocomposite, with platelet-like nanoreinforcementsembedded in a micronicmatrix;
4. Micro/nanocomposite, containing both rounded and elongated nanoreinforcements, embedded in a micronicmatrix;
5. Bi-phasic composite made by two immiscible ultra-fine phases;
6. Multi-phasic composite made by three (or more) immiscible nanophases;
7. Nano/nanolayertype composite;
8. Nano-or micro-fibers embedded in a fine matrix;
9. Large second-phase precipitates embedded in a fine matrix.

### Influence Mechanism
1. Reduction in the size of processing flaws
2. “Nanotoughening” effect
3. the higher the extent of transgranularfracture, the higher the toughening ???
## Methods to produce CMCs
The most investigated structural ceramic nanocomposites are Al2O3/SiCand Si3N4/SiC.However, many other different phases such as TiN, TiC, TiO2, ZrO2, Cr3C2, YAG, can be used as nanoreinforcementsin Al2O3, Si3N4, MgO, mulliteor SiAlONceramic matrix.
